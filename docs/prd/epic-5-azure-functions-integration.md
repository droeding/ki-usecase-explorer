# Epic 5: Azure Functions Integration

## Epic Goal
Integrate the existing Azure Functions API backend into the monorepo architecture and establish a unified deployment pipeline that leverages shared packages and maintains consistency with the frontend application.

## Epic Description

**Current State:**
- Azure Functions exist separately in `/api/` folder outside the monorepo structure
- Functions are deployed independently with their own `package.json`
- No shared code or types between frontend and backend
- Separate deployment pipeline for API functions

**Target State:**
- Azure Functions integrated into monorepo as `apps/api/` workspace
- Functions use shared packages for types, utilities, and configuration
- Unified development experience with shared testing and linting
- Single build and deployment pipeline for both frontend and backend
- Consistent code patterns and error handling across the stack

**Integration Points:**
- Migrate existing Azure Functions to `apps/api/` workspace
- Update functions to use shared `@ki-usecase-explorer/types` for API contracts
- Implement shared `@ki-usecase-explorer/config` for environment management
- Use shared `@ki-usecase-explorer/db` for database access patterns
- Establish unified testing and deployment workflows

## Stories

### Story 5.1: Azure Functions Workspace Migration
**Goal:** Move Azure Functions from `/api/` to `apps/api/` and integrate with monorepo workspace structure

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want the Azure Functions integrated into the monorepo workspace so that I can use shared packages and have a consistent development experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Azure Functions migrated to `apps/api/` workspace
2. `package.json` configured as workspace member with proper dependencies
3. Functions reference shared packages instead of local duplicates
4. All existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged
5. Development server starts successfully with both frontend and API
6. Azure deployment configuration updated for new structure

### Story 5.2: Shared Type System Integration
**Goal:** Replace local types in Azure Functions with shared type definitions from `@ki-usecase-explorer/types`

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across frontend and backend so that API contracts are automatically synchronized and type-safe.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All API route handlers use shared types for request/response contracts
2. Database models use shared interfaces from types package
3. Validation schemas use shared types for consistency
4. TypeScript compilation successful across all workspaces
5. No type mismatches between frontend API calls and backend handlers
6. Auto-completion works correctly in IDE for shared types

### Story 5.3: Unified Configuration Management
**Goal:** Implement shared configuration patterns for environment variables and constants across frontend and Azure Functions

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want centralized configuration management so that environment variables and constants are consistent between frontend and backend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Azure Functions use `@ki-usecase-explorer/config` for environment variables
2. API endpoints and constants shared between frontend and backend
3. Database connection configuration centralized and reusable
4. Environment-specific settings properly managed
5. Local development and Azure deployment configurations work correctly
6. No hardcoded URLs or magic strings in function code

### Story 5.4: Testing Integration and Coverage
**Goal:** Establish comprehensive testing for Azure Functions using shared testing utilities and achieving full coverage

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for Azure Functions so that I can confidently deploy changes and maintain code quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unit tests for all Azure Functions with >80% coverage
2. Integration tests for database operations and external APIs
3. API contract tests ensuring frontend/backend compatibility
4. Shared testing utilities for common test patterns
5. Tests run successfully in both local and CI environments
6. Test results integrated into monorepo test suite

### Story 5.5: Unified Deployment Pipeline
**Goal:** Create a single deployment pipeline that builds and deploys both frontend and Azure Functions from the monorepo

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want a single deployment command that deploys both frontend and backend so that releases are coordinated and deployment is simplified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Single GitHub Actions workflow for complete application deployment
2. Azure Functions build process integrated with monorepo build system
3. Shared build artifacts and dependencies optimized for deployment
4. Environment-specific deployments (staging, production) work correctly
5. Rollback capability for both frontend and backend components
6. Deployment logs and monitoring unified for full-stack visibility

## Dependencies

**Requires (Completed):**
- ✅ Story 4.1: Monorepo Structure Setup
- ✅ Story 4.2: Code Migration to Monorepo Pattern

**Enables:**
- Epic 6: Advanced API Features
- Epic 7: Monitoring and Observability
- New feature development with full-stack consistency

## Technical Constraints

**Azure Functions Limitations:**
- Must maintain Azure Functions v4 runtime compatibility
- Function app structure requirements for deployment
- Environment variable management in Azure portal

**Monorepo Considerations:**
- Workspace dependencies must be resolved for deployment
- Build artifacts must be properly packaged for Azure
- Shared packages must be bundled or installed in function context

**Migration Risks:**
- Existing API endpoints must remain functional during migration
- Database connections and external integrations must be preserved
- Performance should not degrade compared to current setup

## Success Metrics

1. **Development Experience:**
   - Single `npm run dev` starts both frontend and API
   - Shared types prevent API contract mismatches
   - Code reuse across frontend/backend increases

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Test coverage >80% for all Azure Functions
   - No TypeScript errors across entire workspace
   - Consistent code patterns and error handling

3. **Deployment Efficiency:**
   - Single deployment command for full application
   - Build time not significantly increased
   - Zero-downtime deployments possible

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Reduced code duplication between frontend/backend
   - Easier to add new API endpoints with shared types
   - Consistent configuration management

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All existing API functionality preserved
- [ ] No breaking changes to frontend API calls
- [ ] Test suite passes with increased coverage
- [ ] Build and deployment processes work end-to-end
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation updated for new structure
