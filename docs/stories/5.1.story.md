**Creation Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Story Dependencies:** 
- **Requires:** Story 4.1 (Monorepo Structure Setup) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requires:** Story 4.2 (Code Migration to Monorepo Pattern) ✅ COMPLETED

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **the existing Azure Functions migrated from `/api/` to `apps/api/` workspace**,
so that **the backend API is integrated into the monorepo structure and can use shared packages**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Migrate Azure Functions to monorepo workspace:
   - Move Azure Functions from `/api/` to `apps/api/` directory
   - Configure `apps/api/package.json` as proper workspace member
   - Update workspace dependencies to reference shared packages
   - Preserve all existing function configurations and structure

2. **AC2:** Configure workspace dependencies correctly:
   - Add `@ki-usecase-explorer/db` dependency for database access
   - Add `@ki-usecase-explorer/types` dependency for type definitions
   - Add `@ki-usecase-explorer/config` dependency for configuration
   - Update all import statements to use workspace packages

3. **AC3:** Maintain Azure Functions compatibility:
   - Preserve `host.json` and function-specific configurations
   - Ensure Azure Functions runtime v4 compatibility
   - Maintain existing API endpoints and functionality
   - Preserve environment variable handling

4. **AC4:** Update development workflow:
   - Ensure `npm run dev` starts both frontend and API functions
   - Configure proper build processes for Azure Functions
   - Update VS Code tasks and debugging configuration
   - Validate local development server functionality

5. **AC5:** Update deployment configuration:
   - Update Azure Static Web Apps deployment to point to `apps/api/`

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Current Azure Functions Analysis:
```
/api/
├── host.json              # Azure Functions runtime configuration
├── package.json           # Independent package with Azure Functions dependencies
├── evaluations/           # Evaluation CRUD endpoints
├── results/               # Results aggregation endpoints  
├── reviewers/             # Reviewer management endpoints
├── test-azure-ai/         # Azure OpenAI integration testing
├── usecases/              # Use case management endpoints
└── prisma/               # Database schema (duplicate of packages/db)
```

### Target Workspace Structure:
```
apps/api/
├── host.json              # Azure Functions runtime configuration (preserved)
├── package.json           # Workspace member with shared dependencies
├── evaluations/           # Evaluation endpoints (using shared types)
├── results/               # Results endpoints (using shared types)
├── reviewers/             # Reviewer endpoints (using shared types)
├── test-azure-ai/         # Azure OpenAI endpoints (using shared config)
└── usecases/              # Use case endpoints (using shared types)
```

### Key Migration Patterns:

**npm Workspace Configuration:**
Based on Context7 npm documentation, the workspace setup should follow:
```json
{
  "name": "@ki-usecase-explorer/api",
  "dependencies": {
    "@ki-usecase-explorer/db": "workspace:*",
    "@ki-usecase-explorer/types": "workspace:*",
    "@ki-usecase-explorer/config": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

**Azure Functions Core Tools Integration:**
- Azure Functions v4 runtime compatibility must be maintained
- `host.json` configuration preserved exactly as-is
- Function app structure requirements for deployment preserved
- Environment variable management adapted to use shared config

**Import Pattern Migration:**
```typescript
// Before (local imports)
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

// After (workspace imports)  
import { prisma } from '@ki-usecase-explorer/db';
import { UseCase, ApiResponse } from '@ki-usecase-explorer/types';
import { getConfig } from '@ki-usecase-explorer/config';
```

### Azure Functions Workspace Requirements:

**Package.json Configuration:**
- Must include Azure Functions dependencies (`@azure/functions`, etc.)
- Workspace dependencies using `workspace:*` pattern
- Build scripts compatible with Azure deployment
- Proper TypeScript configuration for function compilation

**Host.json Preservation:**
- Runtime version must remain compatible with Azure deployment
- Function timeout and memory settings preserved
- CORS configuration maintained for frontend integration
- Logging and monitoring settings unchanged

**Function Structure Compatibility:**
- Individual function folders maintained (`evaluations/`, `usecases/`, etc.)
- `function.json` files preserved exactly
- Route configurations maintained for API compatibility
- HTTP trigger bindings unchanged

### Testing Requirements:

**Local Development Testing:**
- Azure Functions Core Tools must start successfully from `apps/api/`
- All API endpoints accessible at expected URLs
- Database connections work using shared packages
- Environment variables load correctly from shared config

**Integration Testing:**
- Frontend API calls continue to work unchanged
- Database operations use shared Prisma client
- Type safety maintained across frontend/backend boundary
- Error handling and logging function correctly

### Deployment Considerations:

**Azure Static Web Apps Configuration:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow update
api_location: "apps/api"  # Updated from "api"
app_location: "apps/web"  # Already updated in Story 4.1
```

**Build Process Requirements:**
- Workspace dependencies must be resolved for deployment
- Shared packages bundled or installed in function context
- Azure Functions build process compatible with monorepo structure
- No circular dependencies between packages

### Rollback Plan:

**Migration Safety:**
- Keep original `/api/` folder as backup during migration
- Test each function endpoint after migration
- Validate deployment process before removing backup
- Atomic git commits for easy rollback if needed

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations work with shared packages
- [ ] Frontend integration unchanged
- [ ] Local development server starts successfully
- [ ] Deployment process completes without errors

## Dev Notes

**FOCUS:**
- This is a STRUCTURAL migration, NOT a functional change
- All existing API functionality must be preserved exactly
- Focus on workspace integration and shared package usage
- Maintain Azure Functions deployment compatibility

**CRITICAL MIGRATION STEPS:**
1. **Preserve Functionality:** Every API endpoint must work identically after migration
2. **Workspace Integration:** Use shared packages instead of local duplicates
3. **Development Workflow:** Maintain seamless local development experience
4. **Deployment Compatibility:** Ensure Azure deployment continues to work

**DEPENDENCIES:**
- **Requires:** Completed monorepo structure from Stories 4.1 & 4.2
- **Uses:** All shared packages created in Story 4.2
- **Enables:** Story 5.2 (Shared Type System Integration)

**QUALITY GATES:**
- No API endpoint functionality changes
- All tests pass after migration
- Local development works with `npm run dev`
- Production deployment succeeds with new structure
- Performance maintained or improved

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Azure Functions unit tests with >80% coverage
- Test function handlers with shared types
- Validate database operations using shared packages
- Test error handling and validation logic

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end API tests with frontend integration
- Database connection tests using shared Prisma client
- Environment configuration tests with shared config
- Azure Functions runtime compatibility tests

**Manual Testing:**
- Start local development server: `npm run dev`
- Test all API endpoints in browser/Postman
- Verify database operations work correctly
- Test Azure deployment with new structure

**Acceptance Testing:**
- All existing API functionality preserved
- Frontend integration unchanged
- Development workflow improved with shared packages
- Deployment process simplified and reliable
