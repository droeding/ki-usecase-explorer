# Wasp Migration Strategy: ki-usecase-explorer-v3

## Executive Summary
Migration from Next.js + Azure Static Web Apps template to Wasp full-stack framework. Given the early stage of the project (template phase), this represents an optimal migration opportunity with minimal technical debt.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Azure Functions (Node.js)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Azure) with Prisma ORM
- **Deployment**: Azure Static Web Apps (token-based)
- **Testing**: Jest + Testing Library

### Current Project Status
- ‚úÖ Template/boilerplate stage
- ‚úÖ Minimal custom code
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure already defined
- ‚úÖ BMad Method integration complete

## Migration Strategy: Clean Slate Approach (UPDATED)

### Phase 1: Complete Wasp Replacement (Week 1)
**Goal**: Replace entire Next.js project with Wasp application

#### 1.1 Backup & Archive Existing Project
```bash
# Create backup of current state
cp -r ki-usecase-explorer-v3 ki-usecase-explorer-v3-backup
```

#### 1.2 Create New Wasp Application
```bash
# Remove existing content (keep docs & configs)
# Create new Wasp application in same directory
wasp new ki-usecase-explorer-v3-wasp
```

#### 1.3 Migrate Essential Configurations
- Preserve BMad Method setup (.bmad-core)
- Migrate environment configurations
- Preserve documentation and deployment scripts
- Keep Git history and project metadata

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Implement core functionality in Wasp

#### 2.1 Database & Entities
- Migrate Prisma schema to Wasp entities
- Set up database relationships
- Configure migrations

#### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization
- Implement Wasp's built-in auth
- Configure user management
- Set up role-based access

#### 2.3 Core API Development
- Migrate Azure Functions to Wasp Actions/Queries
- Implement type-safe API calls
- Add error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Frontend Migration (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Migrate UI components and pages

#### 3.1 Component Migration
- Migrate React components to Wasp pages
- Adapt Tailwind CSS styles
- Implement client-side routing

#### 3.2 State Management
- Leverage Wasp's built-in state management
- Migrate any existing state logic
- Implement real-time features if needed

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 7)
**Goal**: Ensure feature parity and quality

#### 4.1 Testing Migration
- Adapt Jest tests to Wasp structure
- Add Wasp-specific testing
- Implement integration tests

#### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries
- Configure caching strategies
- Implement monitoring

### Phase 5: Deployment & Cutover (Week 8)
**Goal**: Deploy Wasp application and transition

#### 5.1 Deployment Strategy
- Configure Wasp deployment (Railway/Fly.io recommended)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure environment variables

#### 5.2 Gradual Cutover
- Deploy Wasp application to staging
- Run parallel testing
- Execute production cutover

## Key Advantages of This Migration

### Technical Benefits
1. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with automatic API generation
2. **Simplified Stack**: Single framework instead of Next.js + Azure Functions
3. **Built-in Features**: Authentication, authorization, database management
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, automatic code generation
5. **Real-time Capabilities**: WebSocket support out of the box

### Operational Benefits
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Single deployment target instead of Azure Static Web Apps + Functions
2. **Better DX**: Unified development experience
3. **Faster Development**: Less boilerplate, more features out of the box
4. **Modern Deployment**: Railway/Fly.io with better developer experience

## Migration Decision Matrix

| Aspect | Next.js + Azure | Wasp | Migration Impact |
|--------|----------------|------|------------------|
| Development Speed | Medium | High | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Faster iteration |
| Type Safety | Manual setup | Built-in | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Better DX |
| Authentication | Custom Azure AD | Built-in | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Simplified |
| Database | Manual Prisma | Integrated | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Less config |
| Deployment | Azure SWA | Railway/Fly.io | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Simpler process |
| Team Learning | Known stack | New framework | ‚¨áÔ∏è Learning curve |
| Enterprise Support | Excellent | Growing | ‚¨áÔ∏è Less mature |

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Green)
- Early project stage
- Minimal custom code
- Similar React/TypeScript stack

### Medium Risk (Yellow)
- Team learning curve for Wasp
- Deployment platform change
- New tooling ecosystem

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel Development**: Keep both versions during transition
2. **Incremental Migration**: Move features one by one
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Document all architectural decisions
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to continue with Next.js

## Recommended Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | Wasp app setup, architecture comparison |
| Phase 2 | 2 weeks | Core backend functionality |
| Phase 3 | 2 weeks | Frontend migration |
| Phase 4 | 1 week | Testing and optimization |
| Phase 5 | 1 week | Deployment and cutover |
| **Total** | **8 weeks** | **Full migration complete** |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create parallel Wasp application
2. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 foundation setup
3. **Weekly Reviews**: Assess progress and adjust timeline
4. **Go/No-Go Decision**: End of Phase 2 (week 4)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Feature parity with existing template
- [ ] Improved development velocity
- [ ] Successful deployment to production
- [ ] Team confidence with new stack
- [ ] Performance equal or better than current setup
